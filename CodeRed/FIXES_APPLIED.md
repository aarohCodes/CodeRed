# 🔧 Fixes Applied - Audio & User Query Issues

## Problems Identified

### 1. ❌ Duplicate Endpoint
**Issue**: Two `@app.post("/kitchen_converse")` decorators in `main.py` causing the second to override the first
**Impact**: Inconsistent behavior and missing functionality

### 2. ❌ ElevenLabs Voice ID Error
**Issue**: In `elevenlabs_utils.py`, voice_id was hardcoded incorrectly in the URL
```python
# WRONG:
url = f"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{QPBKI85w0cdXVqMSJ6WB}"

# This put the actual voice ID in the URL incorrectly
```
**Impact**: API calls would fail or use wrong voice

### 3. ❌ No Audio Playback in Standalone
**Issue**: `voicecommand-standalone.js` wasn't handling audio response
**Impact**: You could see text but couldn't hear the response

### 4. ❌ Wrong Request Field
**Issue**: Standalone was sending `message` but backend expected `user_query`
**Impact**: Data mismatch between frontend and backend

### 5. ❌ Poor User Prompting
**Issue**: The system wasn't asking what the user wanted in a clear way
**Impact**: Confusing user experience

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Backend Endpoint (`backend/main.py`)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed duplicate `@app.post("/kitchen_converse")` decorators
- ✅ Consolidated into single endpoint that handles both `user_query` AND `message`
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling with try/except
- ✅ Added debug logging (print statements with emojis for easy tracking)
- ✅ Improved Gemini prompt to be more conversational
- ✅ Returns both `text` and `audio_base64` in response

**New Endpoint Logic:**
```python
@app.post("/kitchen_converse")
async def kitchen_converse(request: Request, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # Accept BOTH 'user_query' or 'message'
    payload = await request.json()
    user_query = payload.get("user_query") or payload.get("message", "")
    
    # Better prompting for Gemini
    prompt = f"""You are a friendly kitchen assistant named Kitchen AI...
    User asked: "{user_query}"
    
    Provide a helpful, conversational response (2-4 sentences)...
    """
    
    # Generate text response
    gemini_reply = get_factual_recipe(prompt)
    
    # Generate audio
    audio_bytes = text_to_speech_elevenlabs(gemini_reply)
    audio_base64 = base64.b64encode(audio_bytes).decode("utf-8")
    
    return {
        "text": gemini_reply,
        "audio_base64": audio_base64
    }
```

### 2. Fixed ElevenLabs Utility (`backend/elevenlabs_utils.py`)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Fixed voice_id to be a parameter (not hardcoded in URL)
- ✅ Added debug logging
- ✅ Added error handling with status code checking
- ✅ Added helpful print statements

**Before:**
```python
def text_to_speech_elevenlabs(prompt_text, voice_id="Mayise"):
    url = f"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{QPBKI85w0cdXVqMSJ6WB}"
```

**After:**
```python
def text_to_speech_elevenlabs(prompt_text, voice_id="QPBKI85w0cdXVqMSJ6WB"):
    url = f"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}"
    
    print(f"🔊 Calling ElevenLabs TTS...")
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print(f"❌ ElevenLabs error: {response.status_code}")
        raise Exception(...)
    
    print(f"✅ Audio generated ({len(response.content)} bytes)")
```

### 3. Fixed Standalone Voice Command (`frontend/public/voicecommand-standalone.js`)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Changed request body from `message` to `user_query`
- ✅ Added audio playback function `playAudio()`
- ✅ Added visual "Playing audio..." indicator
- ✅ Added error handling for audio playback
- ✅ Added debug console.log statements

**New Features:**
```javascript
async sendToBackend(text) {
    // Changed field name
    body: JSON.stringify({ user_query: text })  // was 'message'
    
    const data = await response.json();
    
    // Display text
    this.showStatus('You said:', text, data.text);
    
    // Play audio if available
    if (data.audio_base64) {
        this.playAudio(data.audio_base64);
    }
}

playAudio(audioBase64) {
    // Decode base64 → Blob → Audio URL → Play
    const audioBytes = Uint8Array.from(atob(audioBase64), c => c.charCodeAt(0));
    const audioBlob = new Blob([audioBytes], { type: 'audio/mpeg' });
    const audioUrl = URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob);
    const audio = new Audio(audioUrl);
    
    // Show "Playing..." indicator
    audio.play();
}
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### Backend is Running
Check terminal shows:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Test the Fix

1. **Open any HTML page** with the voice command (test.html, profile.html)

2. **Click the microphone button** (bottom-right)

3. **Speak your question** clearly, for example:
   - "What can I cook with chicken?"
   - "How do I make scrambled eggs?"
   - "What's for dinner tonight?"

4. **Watch the terminal** for debug output:
   ```
   📝 User query: what can I cook with chicken?
   🤖 Calling Gemini AI...
   ✅ Gemini response: I'd suggest making chicken stir-fry...
   🎤 Generating audio with ElevenLabs...
   🔊 Calling ElevenLabs TTS for text: I'd suggest making...
   ✅ Audio generated successfully (45234 bytes)
   ✅ Audio encoded to base64 (60312 chars)
   ```

5. **You should:**
   - See your transcript in the popup
   - See the AI's text response
   - **HEAR the audio playing** 🔊
   - See "🔊 Playing audio..." indicator

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still no audio?

**Check Console (F12):**
```javascript
// You should see:
🚀 Sending to backend: what can I cook
✅ Backend response: {text: "...", audio_base64: "..."}
🔊 Playing audio response...
🎵 Audio started playing
✅ Audio playback finished
```

**Check Backend Terminal:**
```
📝 User query: ...
🤖 Calling Gemini AI...
✅ Gemini response: ...
🎤 Generating audio with ElevenLabs...
🔊 Calling ElevenLabs TTS...
✅ Audio generated successfully
```

### Common Issues:

1. **"Audio playback blocked"**
   - Click anywhere on the page first (browser security)
   - Then try the voice command again

2. **"ElevenLabs API error: 401"**
   - Check `.env` file has correct `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
   - Verify the key hasn't expired

3. **"Failed to connect to backend"**
   - Make sure backend is running on port 8000
   - Check CORS is allowing your origin

4. **No audio in response**
   - Check backend logs for ElevenLabs errors
   - Verify `audio_base64` field exists in JSON response

## 🎉 What's Working Now

1. ✅ **Single endpoint** handles all requests
2. ✅ **ElevenLabs generates audio** correctly
3. ✅ **Audio is returned** as base64
4. ✅ **Frontend decodes and plays** audio automatically
5. ✅ **Visual feedback** shows when audio is playing
6. ✅ **Debug logging** helps track the flow
7. ✅ **Better prompts** make AI more conversational
8. ✅ **Error handling** catches and displays issues

## 🚀 Next Steps

Try these questions to test:
