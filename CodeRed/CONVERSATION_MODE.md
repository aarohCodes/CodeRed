## 🎛️ Technical Details

### Auto-Restart Listening

- Checks if conversation mode is still active
- Automatically starts listening again
- No button clicks needed!

### Error Handling

- Shows error message
- Waits 2 seconds
- Automatically restarts listening
- Conversation continues!

### Stop Current Audio

- Clicking button stops conversation immediately
- Any playing audio stops
- Voice recognition stops

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No response after first question"

**Fix:** Make sure browser allows microphone access
- Chrome/Edge: Click lock icon in address bar
- Allow microphone permission

### "Audio cuts out"

**Fix:** Check your speakers/volume
- Make sure system volume is up
- Check browser isn't muted

### "Can't hear AI responses"

**Fix:** Click anywhere on page first
- Browsers block auto-play until user interaction
- After first click, audio should work

### "Keeps listening but doesn't respond"

**Fix:** Speak clearly and wait for final transcription
- AI waits for you to finish speaking
- Pause briefly when done
- Look for "Final transcript" in console (F12)
