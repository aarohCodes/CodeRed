# âœ… FIXED: Voice Command Setup

## What Was Wrong:
The `index.html` had a redirect to `test.html`, which prevented React from loading and caused the "Unexpected token '<'" error.

## What I Fixed:

1. **Removed redirect** from `public/index.html`
2. **Created standalone voice command** for non-React pages (`voicecommand-standalone.js`)
3. **Added voice command** to `test.html`

## Now You Have TWO Options:

### Option 1: React App with Voice Command
**URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- Full React app with VoiceCommand component
- Modern UI with animations
- Voice command button in bottom-right

**To use:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Option 2: Standalone test.html with Voice Command
**URL**: `http://localhost:3000/test.html`
- Your existing landing page
- Voice command button added
- Works independently

## ðŸš€ Testing Now:

1. **Start your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Choose which page to test:**
   - React App: `http://localhost:3000` (App.jsx with VoiceCommand)
   - Landing Page: `http://localhost:3000/test.html` (with standalone voice)

3. **Look for the microphone button** (bottom-right, green)

4. **Say "Hey Kitchen"** and then your command

## Both Pages Now Have:
- âœ… Custom "Hey Kitchen" wake word
- âœ… Voice transcription
- âœ… Backend AI responses
- âœ… Visual feedback

## Want to Make test.html the Default Again?

If you want `test.html` to be the landing page, you can either:

**A) Add redirect back** (but voice won't work in React):
```html
<script>window.location.href = '/test.html';</script>
```

**B) Or just access it directly:**
`http://localhost:3000/test.html`

The voice command will work on both pages now! ðŸŽ¤âœ¨
