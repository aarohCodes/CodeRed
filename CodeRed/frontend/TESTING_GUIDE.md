# ✅ Voice Command Setup Complete!

## Files Ready:
- ✅ Custom wake word: `Hey-Kitchen_en_wasm_v3_0_0.ppn`
- ✅ Model parameters: `porcupine_params.pv`
- ✅ Access key configured in `.env`
- ✅ VoiceCommand component updated
- ✅ Backend endpoint ready at `/kitchen_converse`

## 🚀 How to Test:

### Step 1: Start Backend (Terminal 1)
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Step 2: Start Frontend (Terminal 2)
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test Voice Commands
1. **Open your browser** (Chrome recommended)
2. **Look for the microphone button** in bottom-right corner
3. **Allow microphone permissions** when prompted
4. **Green button** = Wake word detection is active
5. **Say "Hey Kitchen"** clearly
6. **Wait for red pulsing button** = Now listening
7. **Speak your command**, for example:
   - "What recipes can I make?"
   - "Give me a dinner idea"
   - "What's in my kitchen?"

### Expected Behavior:
1. 🟢 Green button = Listening for "Hey Kitchen"
2. 🔴 Red pulsing = Recording your command
3. 💬 Popup shows:
   - Your transcript
   - AI assistant response from Gemini

## 🔧 Configuration:

### Sensitivity (0.0 - 1.0)
Currently set to `0.7` in VoiceCommand.jsx
- Lower = less false positives, harder to trigger
- Higher = easier to trigger, more false positives

### Wake Word Location
The custom wake word file is in:
`frontend/public/Hey-Kitchen_en_wasm_v3_0_0.ppn`

### Backend URL
Currently: `http://localhost:8000/kitchen_converse`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### Check Browser Console (F12)
Look for these messages:
- ✅ "Porcupine initialized and listening for wake word"
- ✅ "Wake word 'Hey Kitchen' detected!"
- ✅ "Speech recognition started"

### Common Issues:

**Wake word not detecting:**
- Speak clearly and close to microphone
- Try saying "Hey Kitchen" with emphasis on both words
- Increase sensitivity in VoiceCommand.jsx

**No microphone access:**
- Click lock icon in browser address bar
- Allow microphone permissions
- Reload page

**Backend not responding:**
- Check if backend server is running (port 8000)
- Look for errors in backend terminal
- Verify Gemini API is configured

**"Access key" error:**
- Check `.env` file has correct key
- Restart frontend server after .env changes

## 📝 Example Voice Commands:

Try these natural commands:
- "Hey Kitchen... what can I cook for dinner?"
- "Hey Kitchen... give me a recipe with chicken"
- "Hey Kitchen... what's a quick breakfast idea?"
- "Hey Kitchen... how do I make pasta?"

## Next Steps:

1. Test the basic wake word detection
2. Try different voice commands
3. Check backend responses in console
4. Adjust sensitivity if needed
5. Add more kitchen inventory items for better responses

Happy cooking! 🍳✨
