## How to Test

### Option 1: Voice Command (Hands-Free)

2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm start`
3. Look for green microphone button in bottom-right corner
4. Say **"Hey Kitchen"** to activate
5. When it turns red and starts listening, speak your command
6. It will:
   - Show your transcript
   - Display the text response
   - **Play the audio automatically** âœ¨
   - Show "Playing..." indicator while audio plays

### Option 2: Manual Test (Type to Test)
1. Click **"Test Kitchen Assistant ðŸ§ª"** button in top-right corner

## Technical Details

### Audio Flow
```
User speaks/types
    â†“
Backend receives query
    â†“
Gemini AI generates response text
    â†“
ElevenLabs converts text to speech
    â†“
Backend returns: { text, audio_base64 }
    â†“
Frontend decodes base64 â†’ Blob â†’ Audio URL
    â†“
Audio plays automatically
```

### Audio Playback Code
```javascript
const audioBytes = Uint8Array.from(atob(audioBase64), c => c.charCodeAt(0));
const audioBlob = new Blob([audioBytes], { type: 'audio/mpeg' });
const audioUrl = URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob);
const audio = new Audio(audioUrl);
audio.play();
```

## Troubleshooting

### Audio doesn't play
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend is returning `audio_base64` field
- Check that ElevenLabs API key is configured in backend
- Try clicking the page first (browsers block auto-play until user interaction)

### Backend errors
- Make sure ElevenLabs API key is in backend `.env`
- Check that `elevenlabs_utils.py` is properly imported
- Verify endpoint returns both `text` and `audio_base64`

### Voice command not working
- Check `.env` file has `REACT_APP_PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY`
- Verify wake word file exists in `public/Hey-Kitchen_en_wasm_v3_0_0.ppn`
- Check browser microphone permissions
- Try manual test button first to verify backend connection

## Success! ðŸŽŠ

Your Kitchen Assistant now:
1. Listens for "Hey Kitchen" wake word
2. Transcribes your speech to text
3. Sends to Gemini AI for response
4. Converts response to speech with ElevenLabs
5. Plays audio automatically with visual feedback

**The complete voice-to-voice pipeline is working!** ðŸš€
