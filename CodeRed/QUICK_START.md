## ðŸŽ¤ Quick Start Guide - "Hey Kitchen" Voice Assistant

### Step 1: Start Backend
```powershell
cd c:\Users\aaroh\CodeRed\backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
âœ… Server should start on `http://localhost:8000`

### Step 2: Open Your Page
- Open `profile.html` or `analytics.html` in Chrome/Edge
- Grant microphone permission when asked

### Step 3: Use Voice Commands
1. **Say "Hey Kitchen"** - Activates the assistant
2. **Speak your command** - e.g., "What can I cook with chicken?"
3. **Listen to response** - AI responds with voice
4. **Continue conversation** - No need to say "Hey Kitchen" again
5. **Click button to stop** - Returns to wake word mode

### Visual Indicators
- ðŸ‘‚ **Green (breathing)** = Waiting for "Hey Kitchen"
- ðŸŽ¤ **Red (pulsing)** = Listening to you
- ðŸ”Š **Blue (pulsing)** = Speaking response
- ðŸ’¬ **Solid green** = Active conversation

### Common Issues

**"Hey Kitchen" not responding?**
